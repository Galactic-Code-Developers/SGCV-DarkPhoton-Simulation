# SGCV Dark Photon Simulation Toolkit

This repository provides a GEANT4-based simulation environment to model exotic Higgs decays under the Superluminal Graviton Condensate Vacuum (SGCV) framework.

## Key Features
- Simulates Higgs → γγ decays with optional superluminal dark photon intermediates.
- Computes Δt (time-of-flight) and Δx (displacement) anomalies.
- Supports visualization of SGCV signatures via Python plots.
- Includes Colab-ready notebook for rapid testing.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Galactic-Code-Developers/SGCV-Simulation.git
cd SGCV-Simulation
